# drum_space

## Drum Patterns from LatentÂ Space: 
I collected 33K non-trivial unique drum beats from midis available online, used a neural network with to build a space of latent representation of these beats and to generate new ones. Finally, I mapped all of them into 2D space using the t-SNE algorithm.
